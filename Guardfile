# A sample Guardfile
# More info at https://github.com/guard/guard#readme


# Make sure this guard is ABOVE any other guards using assets such as jasmine-headless-webkit
# It is recommended to make explicit list of assets in `config/application.rb`
# config.assets.precompile = ['application.js', 'application.css', 'all-ie.css']
guard 'rails-assets' do
  watch(%r{^app/assets/.+$})
  watch('config/application.rb')
